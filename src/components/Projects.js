                                    I have actively worked on a variety of impactful projects across Web Development, Natural Language Processing (NLP), GenAI ,  and Computer Vision, each aligning with trending and in-demand technologies. In Web Development, I created dynamic multi-page websites and responsive Flask-based web apps with user/admin login systems, integrating functionalities like data prediction, chat history, and model tracking via DVC and CICD for deployment and continous integration. My NLP project focused on building intelligent chatbots capable of understanding context, detecting emotional cues, and supporting multi-language conversations. I also explored the development of a toxicity detection model using LSTM networks, enhancing it with real-time feedback and text classification. In the domain of Computer Vision, I built digit and operator recognition tools using CNNs and OpenCV, and contributed to low-light image enhancement for lunar PSR region analysis using UNet. Through these projects, I delved into hot topics like multi-modal AI, mental health tech, and AI in space researchâ€”gaining hands-on experience with cutting-edge tools such as OpenAI/Gemini APIs, Hugging Face Transformers, and FastAPI. These experiences not only strengthened my technical skill set but also deepened my understanding of building scalable, human-centric, and research-driven AI applications.
